## **Problem**
A client has approached us that they want to build a site called ULEMHub. They want us to replicate yahoo.com with just HTML & CSS and just these pages and the the section above the fold:

### **Method**
Create folder in Github- UlemHub repository 
shares link so that team members can create branches to work on pages and pull requect and commit work frequently.

 
* Establish a basic design system and code snippets in order to acheive the same cohesive look. 


## **Process**

html, css, PHPStorm, Github, Vercel zoom for communication.

## **Result+Demo**

For  the ULEMHub website, we divided the page.

 We started with writing the html and css we then shared out the outcome and results, we then added css code snippets that each page ,as color, type, search engine feature. and buttons
